1. Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.

2. abstract class
abstract class needs to be extended and its abstract methods should be implemented, it cannot be instantiated.
It can have abstract and non-abstract methods. it can have constructors and static methods also.
and  final methods which will force the subclass not to change the body of the method.
An abstract class can have  abstract method, non-abstract method, constructor, and even main() method.

3. abstract method
A method which is declared as abstract and does not have implementation is known as an abstract method.

4. Rule:
If you are extending an abstract class that has an abstract method,
you must either provide the implementation of the method or make this class abstract.

5. The abstract class can also be used to provide some implementation of the interface.
   In such case, the end user may not be forced to override all the methods of the interface.
